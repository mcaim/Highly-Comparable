# Highly Composite

Highly composite numbers are numbers such that divisor function d(n)=sigma_0(n) (i.e., the number of divisors of n) is greater than for any smaller n. Superabundant numbers are closely related to highly composite numbers, and the first 19 superabundant and highly composite numbers are the same.

This python script finds highly composite numbers less than some max term. If the max term is increased you may need to increase the primes it has to choose from.
